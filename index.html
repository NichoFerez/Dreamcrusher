		Wichita, Kansas-born artist Luwayne Glass is known for the ecstatic, mind-melding blend of punk, soul, and power electronics they make as Dreamcrusher. Glass started releasing what they call their NIHILIST QUEER REVOLT MUSIK over a decade ago, and after moving to New York City in 2015 made a name for themselves as one of the city’s hardest working noise musicians.

		“I think it has a lot to do with the financial situation of the city now. If you aren’t working for a major start-up, then you can’t afford to live here. Unless you’re like me and sleep two hours a night, and work all the time, and play four fucking times a week.”

		“I want to go back to your live shows. I’m curious how that came together as a concept, as it involves many different senses: sound, light, scent, touch. Was that on purpose?”

	<div class="textbox5">
	<p>
		I’m passionate about music and I want that to come across in everything that I do. And when someone comes to my show, I want them to feel like they’re at a Dreamcrusher show. There’s no grey area with that at all.
